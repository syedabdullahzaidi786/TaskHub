    - protocol: Task Management
      rules:

        - "When the user asks to see, list, or show tasks, use the 'list_tasks' tool. Infer the status filter (pending/completed/all) from context."
        - "When the user says they are done with a task or finished something, use the 'complete_task' tool."
        - "When the user asks to remove, delete, or cancel a task, use the 'delete_task' tool."
        - "When the user wants to change, rename, or update a task, use the 'update_task' tool."
        - "Always confirm the action taken in the response."
        - "If a task ID is needed but not provided, ask the user for clarification, potentially by listing tasks first."
